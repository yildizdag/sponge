This repo includes the ANSYS Mechanical APDL scripts used for finite element modeling and analysis of a biomimetic material designed based on the hexactinellid sea sponge Euplectella Aspergillum.

All the files can be run via 'Read Input From ...' on ANSYS Mechanical APDL.

The idealization of the material is as follows:

1) Beams in longitudinal direction
2) Beams in circumferential direction
3) Helical Beams (Type 1)
4) Helical Beam (Type 2)
